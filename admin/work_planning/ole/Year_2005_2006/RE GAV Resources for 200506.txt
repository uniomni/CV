Hi Anita



Thanks for inquiring.



I can think of the following activities for next year assisting us with the development of a user guide and technical manual for the AnuGA  software (March to June 2006)



            1: Help designing a logo

            2: Help turning screen outputs into production quality graphics (about a dozen or so)

            3: Printing and binding a number (50?) of hard copies (June 2006)



Cheers Ole

Hi everyone



GAV are organising their budget for 05/06 and are asking all Projects if they are able to let them know of all any graphic design, graphics, visualisation, data capture or printing resources. If you do have any of these requirements for RAMP or NRAP, can you please let me know ASAP (or by LUNCHTIME tomorrow at the latest). I need an estimate of the time period, the month and the type of resource.



If you have any queries, please just give me a hoy.



Thanks



Anita
