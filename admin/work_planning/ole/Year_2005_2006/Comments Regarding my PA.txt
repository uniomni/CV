Ole,

Thank you so much for this summary.  I think that it is your ability to coordinate and carry out your research activities in a “no fuss” manner; my lack of appreciation of the technical complexities involved and our reliance on informal communication lines that has resulted in my expressing over exuberant expectations.  You are of cause correct; your present role and responsibilities more than meet expectations and do support the broader integration of the activity.  I think the formalised fortnightly meetings will help immensely with my understanding of the state of your (and the broader) working environment.  In hindsight, I also would like to readdress the comments I provided in the 04-05 review, if you could forward this to me.

Your contributions and efforts form the backbone of our inundation work, this is core business and critical for GA’s success in its ATWS endeavours and I will do my utmost to support yourself and the development of this activity.

Lets talk!

Hi Matt



I have been thinking more about what you said about me taking a lead with respect to stitching of topographies in WA and coaching the GIS people in the process. This makes perfect sense and it almost goes without saying as such a project is an integral part of developing and applying our models further.



What bothers me is that I haven't been able to communicate to you well enough the exact nature of the project and that you, consequently, is calling for more leadership on my part. This document serves two purposes: Trying to communicate to you the main issues of the project and secondly helping me focussing my thoughts. 





Summary

Fifteen months ago RAMP had a piece of code that showed a handful of large blue triangles slowly going "clonk....clonk....clonk" as they moved down a slope according to our numerical implementation of the Shallow Water Wave Equation.



Now we have a thriving inundation modelling project, that has been quickly and successfully applied to the catastrophic disasters working group tsunami scenarios and with much more to come. To create the inundation modelling project I have had to simultaneously work at different levels ranging from the mathematical and numerical issues inherent in the problem over people management to political inter-agency issues and presentations in public fora.





1 Designing and implementing the software to make the inundation modelling tool 

·         efficient with respect to computational resources such as time, memory and bandwidth: E.g. a back-of-the-envelope calculation made me realise that the data structure would have to be refactored in order to reach the full potential of the code. It took six weeks, and we can now address scenarios comprising almost one million triangles. The prototypes balked at 150,000.

·         numerically robust (e.g. wrt a variety of inputs). If one is not extremely careful, this kind of software tends to become unstable due to the accumulation of rounding errors. Rather than adding small fixes here and there as these appeared, I decided to isolate the areas where such instabilities could occur and deal with the issue in a few well defined areas

·         flexible: Where some packages such as MOST are tied to particular scenarios (e.g. tsunamis generated by subduction), AnuGA will work well for very general flow scenarios as we saw recently when Adrian was able to model waves generated by submarine landslides. This is a direct consequence of the design choices I made (including the choice of the programming language Python).

·         Portable: The code runs on the following platforms Windows, Linux 32 bit and Linux 64 bit (Corporate cluster).

·         user friendly (not done well enough yet), but some of the basic principles are either implemented or identified in our planning documents

·         maintainable. The code is designed to be as object oriented and modular as practical for ease of maintenance and longevity. Lacking these virtues, most codes die from 'code rot' as they grow into unwieldy messes depending specifically on obsolete platforms and software libraries. Such a code would hardly serve to satisfy the high level drivers.



2 Managing the development process



A decent-sized software project cannot be successfully completed without someone keeping a steady hand on the framework under which the development takes place. The alternative is known as "programmers in the wild". From day one I insisted on and enforced on some basic disciplines for the development process 



·         Documentation strings: Every component (function, class or module) must be equipped with a text string that describes its purpose and expectations (such as pre and post conditions). These strings serve as invaluable automatic on-line documentation useful for programmers and will serve as a backbone of the technical documentation.

·         Revision Control System (RCS): One of my very first actions in GA was to install and promote revision control a discipline which is indispensable when it comes to concurrent collaborative software development. RCS allows seamless merging of files that have been modified independently and simultaneously and it keeps an audit trail of all work that has been done with a record of time, revision number authorship, modified content and a verbose log message. The amount of time and money saved by using RCS was testified by recent Ceanet contracts where vast resources went into manual merging of different versions of EQRM from the time before it was put under RCS.

·         Unit testing. The ability to continually run a monotonously growing testsuite that documents and verifies the correctness of every component of a large software project cannot be under estimated. By having good unit tests one can easily detect if a modification or addition to a code has broken other parts of it and one can refactor code for efficiency without loosing correctness. 

·         Issue tracking: While we haven't yet implemented rigorous automated issue/bug tracking it is on its way.

In addition I have held regular meetings and looked after the minutes and planning documents





3 Leading people and organisations



·         Working with developers ensuring that requirements are well definned, that programming styles and design principles are agreed upon and that disciplines are observed

·         Picking the brain of Stephen Roberts who has researched the field for 15 years.

·         Coaching users of the software (e.g. Adrian, Macca,  Peter Row, Chris Z)

·         Interacting with IT in at times delicate negotiations on how far we can push our needs and what their role should be in regard to the parallel cluster

·         Managing half a dozen contracts with the ANU to bring in further capabilities innumerics, visualisation and parallelism 

·         Presenting capabilities and visions with staff at BoM, CSIRO, GA and more recently at the UN ESCAP meeting.





4 Applied



·         I took a lead in regard to the Cairns case study. Not only did I fight with Chris Zoppou who was then the leader to get the project started I also made it possible for Augusto to complete the damage modelling by coaching and identifying tools that needed to be developed. Some of this will form the backbone of an integrate damage and risk model for the built environment in the future.

·         I took the lead, the responsibility and also did most of the foot work in the tsunami inundation component of Catastrophic Disasters Working Group project. 

This involved dealing with other developers, GIS resources and stakeholders to push the process along. Crucial parts of this work was proper georeferencing and the ability to use model output from e.ge MOST as a boundary condition. We will be able to capitalise on this when we get the URS hazard model, but as you point out it is important that we work together with them to ensure a seamless integration.

·         I liaised with Kathy McInnes and got her interested in doing the Gippsland lakes project jointly and I am currently supervising Adrian doing it.





5 Political



·         Identifying and carrying out the subtle shift from storm surge modeling to inundation modelling in November 2004 has already shown its merits as our role in relation to other institutions is defined more clearly allowing more collaborations.

·         I also identified the need in the organisation for a proper software licensing procedure and took contact with the Australian Government Information Management Office (AGIMO) to investigate the possibilities. This in turn sparked AGIMO to engage with other APS departments and I am currently involved in the steering committee for the Development of a Software Licence for Australian Public Service. 

·         I have been liaising with GA contract management and the dean of Mathematics at the ANU to draft a Head Collaborative agreement that would serve to facilitate further contracts and collaborations







I would suggest you revisit your comment on my 4/5 PA in the light of the above, which I think pretty much sums up the big ticket items of my 4/5 work.

As for driving the inundation project along (with a fist in a velvet glove behind it if you will) - I think that is exactly what I have been doing all along and that path would be my choice for the next years in order to ensure that the project remains aligned with GA and government priorities. 

  

As for merit promotion - I wouldn't loose any sleep, 

As for you not having the full picture of the work required for the project to thrive - I have.



See you

Cheers
