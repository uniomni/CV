\opening{\underline{RE: Pickup of skilled independent VISA subclass 136}}

Dear sir,

I am pleased to inform you that I have been granted a visa for migration 
into Australia (see enclosed grant letter). 
Since I have to be outside Australia for the visa to 
be granted and since I will be attending a conference in LA early March, 
I wish to pick it up with you.

I will approach you on Friday March 2 with the original grant letter and 
my passport. I wish to pick up the visa one week later, 
i.e. Friday March 9 (at the latest).

Please let me know if this is possible and how far away you are from the 
LAX airport by taxi.
You can contact me by fax number +61 2 6125 8651
or by email Ole.Nielsen@anu.edu.au.
Thank you very much

Looking forward to you reply

\closing{Best regards}
