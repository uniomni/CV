\opening{\underline{Re: SMS210 --- Research Fellow.}}

I write in response to your job advertisement posted on the WEB 
early March this year for the APAC funded, level B, three year 
research fellow position at the CMA, SMS.

I am currently working at the RSISE in a temporary position as
a visiting research fellow doing research in data mining, 
data exploration, wavelets and parallel algorithms.

My main expertises are in scientific software development,
high performance computing, and mathematical modelling 
and I believe I meet all of the selection criteria 
listed in the advertisement.
Aside from an extensive variety of technical skills 
I think of myself as a reliable but easy going team player with 
very good communication skills.

Please find enclosed CV, response to the selection criteria, 
selected papers, some recommendation letters, and proof of my PhD degree.
I will be happy to provide additional documentation upon request.
