<p>
</p><h3>Dr Ole Nielsen</h3><img src="ICT_profile_ole_nielsen_files/O_Neilsen.htm" align="left" height="135" width="119">
Dr Ole Nielsen is currently a Computational Scientist in the Risk
Research Group of Geoscience Australia. Ole studied his Bachelor and
Master of Science at Roskilde University Denmark. His PhD is in
Mathematical Modelling and was completed at the Technical University of
Denmark. His thesis was titled “Wavelets in Scientific Computing”. Ole
wanted his studies to be practically focused and his philosophy was “to
involve myself in research and the development of technical or
scientific technologies aimed at concrete applications that have a high
relevance to society”. His current work in Tsunami Inundation Modelling
is closely aligned to this philosophy. <p></p>
<p><b>Ole your studies and knowledge of science is very extensive.
Could you tell us what your studies involved and what type of work you
did whilst studying?</b> <br>“In Denmark I had studied full time and
part time from 1984 to 1990. I studied a variety of discipline areas
including general science, biology, media, and communications. It was
cross disciplinary and problem oriented in its nature and focused on
team and project work. Whilst studying I tutored in computer science.
During my studies I changed to a double degree in computer science and
mathematics. I also took a year off to work as a sound recording
engineer for a recording studio. This included working on the sound
engineering team for the Roskilde Festival a large Danish Rock Festival
that is held once a year. In 1993 there was a recession and it was
difficult to find work in computer science so I applied to undertake a
PhD in Mathematical Modelling at the Technical University of Denmark.
My PhD was focused on the use of wavelet analysis in scientific
computing with applications to fiber optics. </p>
<p>In 1995 I came to the Australian National University (ANU) to
undertake a six month student exchange program, and in 1996 I studied
for seven months at New York University. </p>
<p>In 1998 I worked for a Danish Computing Company UNI•C which was a
Centre for Research and Education in high performance computing. My
work focused on the design and development of parallel image analysis
algorithms. At the same time I applied to undertake a Post Doctorate
Fellowship at ANU as I wanted to go back to Australia. This was funded
by the Danish Research Council and my research was in Wavelets and Data
Mining. I worked with the CSIRO Enterprise Datamining and the Health
Insurance Commission developing tools to analyse very large datasets
and helped look for patterns in Medicare and PBS claims. I enjoyed the
research and the lifestyle of Canberra, so I decided to stay in
Australia and find work here. I also met and fell in love with my wife
towards the end of 1999. We met whilst scuba diving at the Great
Barrier Reef.</p>
<p>In 2000/2001 I was an independent consultant and the main developer
of ‘Pathology Explorer’ WEB data mining applications at CSIRO
Mathematics and Information Science. </p>
<p>In 2001 I gained an ANU Research Fellowship with the Mathematical
Sciences Institute to research analysis of very high dimensional data.
This involved the theoretical side rather than the application side of
data mining and enhanced my understanding of the theory behind high
dimensional regression, multiscale analysis and surface fitting. Some
of the spin offs of my work included DNA matching and software for
parallel computing. I focused on the development of new technologies in
these areas. When I finished my research studies in 2003 I applied for
a position as a Computational Scientist in the Risk Research Group at
Geoscience Australia. However, in 2003 after accepting the position at
Geoscience Australia, I also honoured a commitment to teach computer
science in Thailand at Suranaree University of Technology for months.
This work was with PhD students and involved building a LINUX cluster
as well as developing parallel algorithms for computational science.</p>
<p><b>Ole can you tell us how you came to work in Australia for Geoscience?</b> <br>“In
2003 I started working with Geoscience Australia. It was a natural
progression of my career as I wanted to apply science to problems of
relevance to society. <br><br>In this context I was asked to lead the
Inundation Modelling Project. This project revolves around the
development of ANUGA a collaborative research and development project
with ANU and Geoscience Australia. Its focus is on the development of
software modelling tools for hydrodynamic simulations for use with
Tsunami Impact Modelling. It brings together spatial information,
mathematics, hydrology and computer science and involves the design,
coding, testing and application of modeling applications. ANUGA is
specifically designed to model the process of coastal inundation and is
suitable for modelling structural impacts to infrastructure and to some
extent the resulting economic and social consequences. <br><br>The
software implements the finite volume method of solving the Shallow
Water Wave equation. An important capability of the software is that it
can model the process of wetting and drying as water enters and leaves
an area. This means that it is suitable for simulating water flow onto
a beach or dry land and around structures such as buildings. ANUGA is
written in object oriented programming language Python which can be
readily adapted to changing requirements through out its lifetime
allowing for a flexible and easy to use interface. ANUGA has been
validated against measured results from a wave tank simulation of the
1993 Okushiri Island Tsunami off Hokkaido. A feature of the Tsunami was
a maximum run up of 32 metres observed at the head of the Monai Valley.
The wave tank dataset provided bathymetry and topography along with
initial water depth and wave specifications. It also contained water
depth time series from a wave gauge simulated offshore from the
simulation inundation area. <br><br>The software is based on almost
fifteen years of research at the ANU and three years of development
work at GA and will soon be released under an Open Source license.
Liaisons with Australian Government Information Management Office
(AGIMO) and Department of Education Science and Technology has been
very useful for this process ”. </p>
<p><b>Ole you are working on a very interesting project with ANU and
Geoscience Australia. Can you tell us what it is that you enjoy about
working in the APS/academic environment?</b> <br>“I love the
collaborative project work and the environment fostered by both ANU and
Geosciences Australia. It is wonderful to be able to work with cross
disciplinary teams who are very professional and who value and respect
each others skills, abilities and experiences. The synergies generated
from the combined knowledge and experience is far greater than if we
all work in isolation. It also brings greater momentum to the project
as we can really achieve some fabulous combined effort results that
will benefit the community and society as a whole. <br><br>For
example, immediately after the recent August Tsunami in Indonesia,
Geoscience Australia sent a team of geologists to undertake field
measurements at Shark Bay off the coast of Western Australia. Few
people know that there was a tsunami wave at Shark Bay at the same time
as in Indonesia. By having Geoscience Australia geologists on hand to
immediately undertake the field work and collect the data sets, we are
now able to use the data sets to simulate the tsunami wave and its
impact on the land. It will be invaluable for validating our work and
for predicting the future impact on the region if similar tsunamis were
to occur. This collaborative professional approach, rather than a
competitive approach, is what I enjoy the most about working in
Geoscience Australia. <br><br>Also, it is only possible to undertake
this type of wok in the APS context as industry will not spend the
necessary money required for this type of research. The long term
strategic vision, and the money required, is only available in the
government context”. </p>
<p><b>Ole, you have talked about what you like with regard to the ANUGA
Project. Can you tell us what else it is that the APS environment
offers you that keeps you motivated to work at Geoscience Australia?</b> <br>“There
are many things about the APS context that I enjoy. I have mentioned
the high degree of professionalism in Geoscience Australia, and this is
one of the things that motivates and inspires me to come to work each
morning. I am working with many very talented professional staff across
a range of science and business related disciplines. I also liaise with
the academic world, which I like, and I engage with other government
departments and with industry which makes for a very interesting work
environment. <br><br>Other aspects of the APS that I like include the
employment benefits and that I have a job as exciting and challenging
as the one I have. There is also a degree of job security in this
environment that is hard to find elsewhere. Moreover, there is also the
opportunity to undertake ongoing professional development and I am able
to access mentors internally as required. Last year I was selected to
undertake a professional development program which focused on
leadership and succession planning. I found this very valuable as it
enabled me to improve my skills in leadership, strategic thinking and
high level collaboration, whilst at the same time having access to
internal mentors. I have been given opportunities to lead a project
team and to work on a number of different projects”. </p>

</p><h3>Praphul Palekar</h3><img src="ICT_profile_ole_nielsen_files/P_Palekar.htm" align="left">
Praphul Palekar is currently an IT Team Leader with Centrelink. Praphul
is originally from India and he came to Australia in 2000 to study his
Masters in Information Technology. He first became interested in ICT
during his secondary schooling and went on to study a Bachelor and
Diploma of Electronics at Mumbai University in India. Praphul is
married and has one son. <p></p>
<p><b>Praphul you first studied in India, did you also work in India?</b> <br>Yes
I first worked in India for an electronics and computing company. After
about a year and half in the company I decided I needed to undertake
further study in computing and I wanted to do so overseas. I looked at
European programs but they were so expensive and the cost of living was
also very high compared to Australia so I applied for the Masters
Program at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne and was
accepted in 2000. </p>
<p><b>How did you enjoy your time in Melbourne? </b><br>I really
enjoyed my time in Melbourne at Swinburne University of Technology and
whilst studying I tutored in different areas of computing including
programming. The Masters Program went for two years and I was very
successful and was one of the top students in the course. When I
finished the Masters Program, Centrelink had a Graduate Recruitment
Campaign in place so I applied for a position with them and was
accepted into their graduate program. <br><br>I moved from Melbourne
to Canberra in 2003. The move was good as all my relocation expenses
were covered by Centrelink. My first 15 days of accommodation were also
covered which made moving here much easier. The first role I had in
Centrelink was as a developer. This work included programming in whole
of systems applications and modifications. It was very interesting work
and involved many new opportunities for growth and development. After a
three months probation I became a permanent staff member and I now have
all the benefits associated with being a permanent APS employee. <br><br>In
2005 I was given the opportunity to become a team leader and this role
involved a lot more in the way of managerial responsibilities. I
currently manage a team of five staff and the primary focus of my work
is in the area of database development working on Model 204(M204)
database using Java Script, XML, Java and J2EE. The projects I work on
are developed and written from scratch. </p>
<p><b>Do you like living and working in Canberra? How are you enjoying working at Centrelink?</b> <br>Yes
I do like living and working in Canberra. Now that I have a family I
feel a lot more settled. My life with my family keeps me very busy and
I have a few hobbies such as reading and music which also keep me quite
busy. <br><br>I like working in Centrelink as it provides me with many
different opportunities to develop my skills and to work with clients
in different areas of Centrelink. I find the variety and the diversity
of work and the mix of staff both challenging and rewarding. My current
role requires me to work with many different line managers in the
business of Centrelink and this has enabled me to gain a better
understanding of the different areas of business within Centrelink,
their functions and the overall business processes and procedures. It
has also enabled me to understand how to best use technology to enhance
the business processes of Centrelink. <br><br>Some of the technical
projects that I have been involved are developing Forte Source Code
Management system, Manage project titled “Fontus – M204 IDE”. Fontus is
a graphical IDE developed under Eclipse platform for M204 source code
development/management. </p>
<p><b>What would you like to do in the future?</b> <br>Within
Centrelink as Team Leaders we are able to nominate the type of
professional development we would like to undertake. In this context I
would like to do further business studies, possibly in the area of
Project Management as most of my work is project based and this type of
qualification would be very useful in my work context. Other
possibilities include general business studies as I have the technical
expertise for information technology and I would like to enhance and
develop my business knowledge and skills more to complement my
technical expertise. For me some form of business qualification would
be very valuable. <br><br>On the personal side, I had set myself the
goal of being a manager, own a house, a car, married with a kid, all by
the age of 30 and I have achieved all that. I am very pleased with
where my life is right now. </p>
<p><b>Praphul can you tell us what you like about the APS/Centrelink business environment?</b> <br>Being
new to the APS has been a very positive experience. I have been given a
great deal of support and mentoring from other staff and I have been
able to apply many of the theories I learnt in my course in the
workplace. There are many things that I enjoy about the APS business
environment. Firstly you are given a range of different opportunities
to develop in many different ways. Whilst the work I undertake is very
complex, it is also very interesting and rewarding. The work
environment is quite flexible and I can work from home if necessary,
and this provides me with some flexibility around my family
commitments. <br><br>I also think the APS environment provides good
remuneration for the type of work I undertake. The ongoing benefits of
sick leave and annual leave are very generous. There is also the
possibility of working for many different government departments if you
wish to do so. As technology is a key platform and enabler for
government, there will always be scope for me to be involved with and
work with new and interesting technology applications and projects in
many different work environments. <br><br>I would recommend to anyone interested in an ICT career to consider the APS as an employer of choice. </p>
