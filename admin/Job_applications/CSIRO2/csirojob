Subject: DM: Position in Data Mining with CSIRO Australia

      Job Title             Research Scientist
      Project name          Enterprise Data Mining
      Location              Canberra, Australia
      Benefits              $52K - 70K + Superannuation

(Consideration will be given to an appointment at a higher level for
an outstanding applicant.)

We wish to appoint a Research Scientist to join the highly successful
research and consulting team known as the Enterprise Data Mining
group. This team of computer scientists has a strong track record of
solving data mining problems in many areas of government and the
private sector. The group's research and consulting activities are now
focused on the health industry and e-commerce. The project has a close
working relationship with academics in Australia and overseas, and has
developed strong strategic alliances with key industries. The group
forms a key part of the Data Mining Program in the Advanced
Computational Systems Co-operative Research Centre based in Canberra.

The successful applicant will have a PhD or equivalent in one or more
of the following disciplines: computer science, biostatistics,
epidemiology, electrical or systems engineering, computational
mathematics or a quantitative science or social science. You will also
have a strong track record in both data analysis and research, with an
emphasis on the solution of real world problems. Experience in either
the health industry or e-commerce would be an advantage but is not
essential.

This is an indefinite position and will be located in Canberra.
