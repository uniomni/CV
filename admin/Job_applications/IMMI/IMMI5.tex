\opening{\underline{RE: Pickup of skilled independent VISA subclass 136}}

Dear sir,

This is to confirm that I will arrive in LA Sunday March 4 and wish to pickup
my migrant visa Friday March 9 at your office.
The visa was granted to me on February 6 by the Berlin office (see enclosed grant letter)
and the file reference number is 2000171733.

I have also enclosed a copy of my passport, my flight ticket and email from
Paul Heinjus confirming this arrangement.

You can contact me by fax number +61 2 6125 8651
or (preferably) by email Ole.Nielsen@anu.edu.au.


Looking forward to finalise the migration process with you.

\closing{Best regards}
