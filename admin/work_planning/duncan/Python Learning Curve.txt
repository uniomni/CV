     WxPython for building GUI's  	  (Can be run from 'Start')
     TKinter for building GUI's  	  (alternative)     
     Visual Python for Animation  	  (Run through IDLE)
     MayaVI for 3D visualisation  	  (Mayavi.exe under Program Files)    
     WebWare or Albatros for WEB building (Not installed yet)
     

2: Make very simple GUIs with WxPython and TKinter.
   Compare.


3: Start working towards a design for the mesh generator.
   A: Investigate existing solutions and tools
   B: Discuss requirements with Chris and Steve 
   C: 
   

4: Make Mesh generator GUI prototype
