Done	
	
--------------------------------------------	
	
Turn 'hull.exe' into a proper C-extension

1: Get it from downloads area
2: Compile it
3: Write C-wrapper
4: Modify pmesh to use it.

	
	
	
===============2003===============	

Prepare 5 min talk 25 Aug:
  - ICIAM, visualisations
  - Grid stuff (GRID wkshp + ICIAM)	
	
Write take home message from Grid workshop for Lesley.
Reuse for talk 25 Aug	
	
	
Read papers about wavelet signatures

Timeseries study:
  Use catchment data (XLS)
  TKinter GUI
  Seismic animation
	IDEAS:
	%Maybe use C-routine 'has new data arrived?'  
	%Show graphs from left to right
	#Replay arbitrary events
	#Add time scale
	#check calibration
	#multiple stations
	cycle through stations
	#Station name
	#Show 'real time' per block
	%color code w scale
	Use horizontal channels....
	Have a 24h window
	
	Internal Use:
		Station availability. Array of meters (ambitious)
		List of stations with last update time + color code for age
		Histogram.
		
	Media use:
		Replay earthquake.
		Control speed.
		Arbitray starting point, arbitrary station.
		Colours ?	
		Separate controlling window (optional)
		
	Foyer:
		Like media, except 'real' time	
		
  
Storm surge model:
  Read Steve and Chris report
  port Matlab version to Python

ICIAM talk: SG (Howards graph), parallel algorithm (address jochens observation) + Pypar (from DCS talk) 



Done:
---------

DCS talk: OS, Beowulf, Pypar
