{The MSI business Office} 

\opening{Dear Annette}
 


I have been offered and accepted an ongoing position at Geosciences Australia
as software engineer in their Risk management section.

I therefore regret to tell you that I must terminate my
employment with the MSI per 14 February 2003.

At the same time I wish to retain ties to the MSI in the form of a 
visiting fellowship, if possible. Could you please let me know 
the procedure for this?

Finally, I would take the opportunity to thank you and your colleagues for
making my time here extremely pleasant.
